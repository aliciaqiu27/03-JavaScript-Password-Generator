##  Using Javascript to Make Your Page Interactive

    Javascript is a commonly used text-based programming languaged used to make your HTML page interactive. While HTML and CSS give you the structure and style, Javascript will help to enaage the User to do different things such as generating a password. The purpose of this project is to create a webpage using Javascript to help the User to generate a password that may consist of letters(lowercase or uppercase), numbers, and special characters.

## Usage 

1) Open the Index.html file with Chrome/Firefox web browsers:
1) Click on the "Generate Password" red button. 
2) A prompt will popup and ask how long you want your password to be. See [First question Demo](How-To-Use.PNG). It is important to remember that the password length has to be between 8-128 exclusively. If User puts anything not in between, an alert message will pop up on the screen. User will have to try again.
3) Select Ok (Yes) or Cancel (No) for each questions being asked after User answers the first question properly.
4) A password will be generated based on your choices in the box. See [Click Button Demo](How-To-Use-I.PNG).
